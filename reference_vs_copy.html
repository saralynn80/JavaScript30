    // Referencing something directly will also update that original item.
    // Create a copy of that object if you don't want to update the original!

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // This does not make a copy, it updates the original players array too:
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)


    // Ways to make a copy instead:
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // Create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // Poor man's way of cloning, not great for performance
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
